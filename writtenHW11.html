        express in node.js is a framework that helps build an API and applications. it provides a lot of tools to
        control http requests, middleware and routes. Used to create a server side apps, make requests and responces.
    </li>
    <li>
        mongoose is a library that helps work with MONGO DB database. Performing CRUD operations and establish
        connection to database.
    </li>
    <li>
        mongoose support to define and handle references. It allows to establish relationships between models in app.
    </li>
    <li>
        sowtware design pattern is a reusable solution to a common design problem that occurs in software development.
        Example is Factory pattern, which provides an interface for creating objectsb but allows subclasses decide which
        class to instantiate.
    </li>
    <li>
        model-view-controller it pattern that usually used in soft. dev. It helps to separate everything by 3
        categories.
        model represents data and business logic of app
        view represents presentation layer of app and defines which data is displayed
        controller receive requests from user and interacts with the model to modify or retrieve data and view in render
        in responce
    </li>
    <li>
        model represents data and buisiness logic of the app
        view is responsible for the presentation layer
        controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view
    </li>
    <li>
        latency is a time between sending requests and responces from a server, the lower the better.
        throughput amount of data that can be transferred within a given amount of time
    </li>
    <li>
        because we will improve our performance of the app. the bigger amount of data we can handle the faster our app
        will be.
    </li>
    <li>
        authentification is a process to identify you identity in web
    </li>
    <li>
        user needs to input his name, password, login etc, and then this data goes to database and check if it's
        correct. if yes - user will have an access to app, if login info is not correct user will be declined to receive
        access to the app.
    </li>
    <li>
        express.static used to serve static files such html, images, css
    </li>
    <li>
        const express =require('express')
        const app =express()
        app.use(express.static('public'))
    </li>
    <li>
        jest is a test system in js it used to test. it's popelar because it's simple and intuitive
    </li>
    <li>
        supertest is a library used in combination with jest for testing http servers
    </li>
    <li>
        manual testers people write by hands for all cases and what to expect in the end of test. Automated tests are
        written with testing frameworks like jest and they can run automaticly.
    </li>
    <li>
        unit testing focuses on testing individual units or components of code in isolation to ensure they function
        correctly. Integration testing verifies the interaction between multiple components and ensures they work
        together as expected. End-to-end testing tests the entire application flow, simulating real user scenarios, and
        checks if the system behaves correctly from start to finish.
    </li>
    <li>
        functional testing is test specific functions or features
        refression testing is test to ensure that previously working functionality has not been negatively affected by
        recent code changes
        smoke testing a subset of tests executed to quickly verify if the core features works after build or deployment
        performance testing is test to assess the performance and responsiveness
    </li>
    <li>
        positive testing involves testing the application with valid inputs and expected behavior to ensure it functions
        as intended. Negative testing involves testing the application with invalid inputs or unexpected scenarios to
        check how it handles errors, exceptions, and edge cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        it measure the system performance with maximum load to check the bottlenecks
    </li>
    <li>
        usability testing assesses the user-friendliness and ease of use of a software application
    </li>
    <li>
        because it helps define vulnerabilities, weakneses and risks in app security
    </li>
    <li>
        it's a type of software testing that ensures the app works correctly across different environments, platforms,
        browsers
    </li>
    <li>
        recovery testing is performed to validate the ability of a system to recover from failures or disasters. The aim
        is to determine how well the system can recover its functionality, data integrity
    </li>
    <li>
        it's a final phase testing before the software is released. Usually performs by testers, end users or
        representative group
    </li>
    <li>
        Functional testing: Testing a login feature to ensure that users can successfully authenticate with valid
        credentials.
        Regression testing: Testing a bug fix to verify that the previously identified issue has been resolved and that
        no new issues have been introduced.
        Smoke testing: Testing the core functionalities of an e-commerce website after a new release to ensure that
        users can add items to the cart, proceed to checkout, and complete a purchase.
        Performance testing: Testing a web application under heavy traffic to assess its response time, server load, and
        scalability.
        Security testing: Conducting penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in an application and validate the
        effectiveness of security measures.
        Usability testing: Observing users as they navigate through a mobile app's interface to evaluate the
        intuitiveness and ease of use.
        Compatibility testing: Testing a website on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and devices (desktop,
        mobile) to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.
        Recovery testing: Simulating a server failure and assessing how quickly the system recovers, restores data, and
        resumes normal operation.
        User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Having a group of end users test a new accounting software to verify that it
        meets their specific financial reporting and analysis requirements.
